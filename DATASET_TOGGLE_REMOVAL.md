# Chart Controls Component Refactor - Dataset Toggle Removal

## Overview
Successfully removed the dataset toggle functionality from the chart controls component as requested. The chart now always displays both revenue and orders datasets without the ability to toggle them on/off.

## Changes Made

### 1. Chart Controls Component (`chart-controls.component.ts`)
- **Removed Components:**
  - `showRevenue` and `showOrders` input properties
  - `datasetToggle` output event emitter
  - Dataset toggle buttons from template
  - `getDatasetButtonClass()` method
  - `toggleDataset()` method

- **Simplified Interface:**
  - Component now only handles chart type, timeframe, export, and zoom controls
  - Cleaner, more focused UI without dataset visibility controls

### 2. Sales Chart Component (`sales-chart.component.ts`)
- **Updated Interface:**
  - Removed `showRevenue` and `showOrders` from `SalesChartOptions` interface
  - Simplified options to focus on chart type, timeframe, grouping, zoom, and annotations

- **Always Show Both Datasets:**
  - Removed conditional logic for dataset visibility
  - Both revenue and orders datasets are now always included in chart data
  - Eliminated `toggleDatasetVisibility()` method

### 3. Dashboard Home Component
- **Removed Properties:**
  - `showRevenue` and `showOrders` boolean properties
  - `onDatasetToggle()` event handler method

- **Updated Template:**
  - Removed dataset-related input bindings from chart controls
  - Removed dataset-related event handlers
  - Simplified chart options object

## Benefits of This Refactor

1. **Simplified UI:** Cleaner chart controls without unnecessary toggle buttons
2. **Consistent Data Display:** Both revenue and orders are always visible for complete data analysis
3. **Reduced Complexity:** Less state management and fewer event handlers
4. **Better UX:** Users always see complete data without needing to remember to toggle datasets

## Technical Details

### Before:
- Chart supported showing/hiding individual datasets (revenue and orders)
- Required state management for dataset visibility
- Complex event handling between components

### After:
- Chart always shows both datasets
- Simplified component interfaces
- Reduced code complexity and maintenance overhead

## Files Modified

1. `erpsystem.client/src/app/dashboard/components/chart-controls/chart-controls.component.ts`
2. `erpsystem.client/src/app/dashboard/components/sales-chart/sales-chart.component.ts`
3. `erpsystem.client/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-home/dashboard-home.component.ts`
4. `erpsystem.client/src/app/dashboard/dashboard-home/dashboard-home.component.html`

## Build Status
✅ All changes compile successfully
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ Application builds without issues

## Next Steps
The chart controls component is now cleaner and more focused. If additional chart customization is needed in the future, it can be added through the export functionality or chart type selections without cluttering the interface with dataset toggles.
