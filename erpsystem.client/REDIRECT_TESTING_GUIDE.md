# Testing the Redirect Service

## How to Test the Fixed Redirect Functionality

### Test Case 1: Direct URL Access (Most Important Test)
1. **Open your browser** and navigate directly to a protected route like:
   ```
   http://localhost:YOUR_PORT/dashboard/admin/users
   ```
2. **Expected Result**: You should be redirected to the login page
3. **After Login**: You should be redirected back to `/dashboard/admin/users` (NOT to dashboard)

### Test Case 2: Page Reload Test
1. **Login to the application** normally
2. **Navigate to any protected page** like `/dashboard/sales/orders`
3. **Reload the page** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. **Expected Result**: After authentication, you should stay on `/dashboard/sales/orders`

### Test Case 3: Deep Link with Bookmarks
1. **While logged out**, bookmark a protected route like `/dashboard/inventory/products`
2. **Close the browser** completely
3. **Open browser** and click the bookmark
4. **Expected Result**: After login, you should land on `/dashboard/inventory/products`

### Console Debug Information
Open browser DevTools (F12) and check the Console tab for debug messages:
- `🚀 App initializing, current URL:` - Shows initial URL
- `📂 Storing intended route on app init:` - Confirms route is being stored
- `🚫 Auth Guard: User not authenticated, storing route` - Auth guard working
- `✅ User authenticated, redirecting from public route` - Redirect triggered
- `🔄 NavigateToIntendedRoute called` - Redirect service called
- `📍 Intended route:` - Shows stored route
- `✅ Navigating to intended route:` - Confirms redirect to stored route

### SessionStorage Check
1. **Open DevTools** (F12)
2. **Go to Application tab** > Storage > Session Storage
3. **Look for key** `intendedRoute`
4. **Value should be** the protected route you tried to access

### Test Results Expected:
- ✅ Direct URL access redirects to intended route after login
- ✅ Page reloads preserve the current route
- ✅ Bookmarked protected routes work correctly
- ✅ SessionStorage contains the intended route
- ✅ Console shows proper debug messages

### If Tests Fail:
1. **Check console** for error messages
2. **Verify sessionStorage** has the intended route
3. **Clear browser cache** and try again
4. **Check if guards are properly applied** in routes

## Key Changes Made to Fix the Issue

1. **Created Custom Auth Guard**: Replaced `OktaAuthGuard` with our custom `authGuard` that integrates with `RedirectService`
2. **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive console logging to track the redirect flow
3. **Fixed Route Storage Logic**: Ensured the intended route is stored before authentication checks
4. **Updated App Component**: Improved authentication state handling logic

## Files Modified:
- ✅ `auth.guard.ts` - New custom auth guard
- ✅ `app.routes.ts` - Updated to use custom auth guard
- ✅ `app.component.ts` - Enhanced auth state handling
- ✅ `redirect.service.ts` - Added debug logging
- ✅ `role.guard.ts` - Updated to work with custom auth guard
