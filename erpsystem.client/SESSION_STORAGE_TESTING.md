# Session Storage Testing Guide

## Enhanced Redirect Service with Session Storage Verification

I've enhanced the `RedirectService` with comprehensive debugging and verification to ensure the intended route is properly stored in session storage.

### Key Improvements Made:

1. **Enhanced Storage Verification**: Every time a route is stored, it's immediately verified
2. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed console logs for debugging
3. **URL Cleaning**: Proper URL sanitization before storage
4. **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks around all session storage operations
5. **Debug Method**: Added `debugSessionStorage()` method for troubleshooting

### How to Test Session Storage:

#### Test 1: Verify Session Storage Works
1. **Open DevTools** (F12) → Console tab
2. **Navigate to a protected route** (e.g., `/dashboard/admin/users`) while logged out
3. **Look for these console messages**:
   ```
   🔍 RedirectService Debug:
     - Stored intended route: /dashboard/admin/users
     - Session storage test: PASS
   💾 RedirectService: Successfully stored intended route: /dashboard/admin/users
   ✅ RedirectService: Storage verified successfully
   ```

#### Test 2: Manual Session Storage Check
1. **Open DevTools** (F12) → Application tab
2. **Go to Storage** → Session Storage → Select your domain
3. **Look for key**: `intendedRoute`
4. **Value should be**: The protected route you tried to access (e.g., `/dashboard/admin/users`)

#### Test 3: Console Commands
Run these commands in the browser console to manually test:

```javascript
// Check if intended route is stored
console.log('Stored route:', sessionStorage.getItem('intendedRoute'));

// Manually store a route
sessionStorage.setItem('intendedRoute', '/dashboard/test');

// Verify storage
console.log('Manual test:', sessionStorage.getItem('intendedRoute'));

// Clear storage
sessionStorage.removeItem('intendedRoute');
```

#### Test 4: Full Redirect Flow
1. **While logged out**, navigate to: `http://localhost:PORT/dashboard/sales/orders`
2. **Check console** for storage messages
3. **Login** to the application
4. **Verify** you land on `/dashboard/sales/orders` (not dashboard)
5. **Check console** for navigation messages

### Expected Console Output:

When testing, you should see logs like this:

```
🔍 RedirectService Debug:
  - Stored intended route: null
  - Session storage test: PASS

🚀 AppComponent: Initializing with URL: /dashboard/admin/users
📂 AppComponent: Storing intended route on app init: /dashboard/admin/users
💾 RedirectService: Successfully stored intended route: /dashboard/admin/users
✅ RedirectService: Storage verified successfully
🔍 AppComponent: Verification - stored route: /dashboard/admin/users

🛡️ AuthGuard: Checking auth state for route: /dashboard/admin/users
🛡️ AuthGuard: User authenticated: false
🚫 AuthGuard: User not authenticated, storing route and redirecting to login
📍 AuthGuard: Route being stored: /dashboard/admin/users
📖 RedirectService: Retrieved intended route: /dashboard/admin/users

🔄 RedirectService: Storing current route before login redirect: /dashboard/admin/users
🚫 RedirectService: Not storing public route: /login

[After Login]
✅ AppComponent: User authenticated, navigating from public route
🔄 RedirectService: NavigateToIntendedRoute called
📍 Intended route: /dashboard/admin/users
✅ RedirectService: Navigating to intended route: /dashboard/admin/users
🗑️ RedirectService: Cleared intended route: /dashboard/admin/users
```

### Troubleshooting Session Storage Issues:

#### Issue: No Route Being Stored
**Symptoms**: Console shows "Not storing public route" for protected routes
**Solution**: Check if URL is being cleaned correctly

#### Issue: Storage Verification Fails
**Symptoms**: Console shows "Storage verification failed"
**Possible Causes**:
- Browser has session storage disabled
- Incognito mode with strict settings
- Browser extension interference

#### Issue: Route Not Retrieved After Login
**Symptoms**: Always redirects to dashboard
**Solution**: Check if session storage is cleared between login attempts

### Browser Compatibility Check:

Test in these browsers to ensure session storage works:
- ✅ Chrome (latest)
- ✅ Firefox (latest)  
- ✅ Safari (latest)
- ✅ Edge (latest)

### Production Considerations:

Once testing is complete, you can remove the debug logs by setting a production flag:

```typescript
private readonly isDebugMode = !environment.production;

// Then wrap console.log statements:
if (this.isDebugMode) {
  console.log('Debug message here');
}
```

### Common Session Storage Limitations:

1. **Storage Limit**: ~5-10MB per domain
2. **Browser Tab Scope**: Data persists only for the browser tab
3. **No Cross-Tab Sharing**: Each tab has its own session storage
4. **Clears on Tab Close**: Data is lost when tab/browser is closed

The enhanced redirect service now provides full visibility into the session storage process, making it easy to debug any issues with route storage and retrieval.
