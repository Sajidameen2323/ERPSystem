# Redirect Service Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds intelligent route redirection functionality to the Angular ERP application. When a user tries to access a protected route but is not authenticated, the application will now remember the intended destination and redirect them there after successful authentication, instead of always going to the dashboard.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. New File: `redirect.service.ts`
- **Location**: `src/app/core/services/redirect.service.ts`
- **Purpose**: Manages storing and retrieving intended routes during authentication flow
- **Key Methods**:
  - `storeIntendedRoute(url)`: Stores the route user was trying to access
  - `getIntendedRoute()`: Retrieves the stored intended route
  - `navigateToIntendedRoute(fallback)`: Navigates to stored route or fallback
  - `storeCurrentRouteAndRedirectToLogin()`: Stores current route and redirects to login

### 2. Modified: `app.component.ts`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added `RedirectService` injection
  - Updated authentication state handling to use redirect service
  - Stores intended route when user lands on protected page without authentication
  - Navigates to intended route after successful authentication

### 3. Modified: `guest.guard.ts`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added `RedirectService` injection
  - Updated to navigate to intended route instead of always going to dashboard

### 4. Modified: `role.guard.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `RedirectService` injection
  - Stores current route before redirecting unauthenticated users to login
  - Updated error handling to preserve intended route

## How It Works

### User Flow Example:
1. **Unauthenticated user visits**: `/dashboard/sales/orders`
2. **Application stores**: `/dashboard/sales/orders` as intended route
3. **User redirected to**: `/login`
4. **After authentication**: User is redirected to `/dashboard/sales/orders` (not dashboard)

### Key Features:
- **Session Storage**: Uses `sessionStorage` to persist intended route across page reloads
- **Public Route Filtering**: Doesn't store login, callback, or unauthorized routes
- **Fallback Support**: Falls back to dashboard if no intended route is stored
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Clears stored route after successful navigation

## Technical Implementation

### Storage Strategy
- Uses `sessionStorage` instead of `localStorage` for security
- Key: `'intendedRoute'`
- Automatically cleared after successful navigation

### Route Filtering
Public routes that won't be stored as intended routes:
- `/login`
- `/unauthorized`
- `/login/callback`
- `/` (root)

### Integration Points
The redirect service integrates with:
- **App Component**: Initial route detection and auth state handling
- **Guards**: Route protection and authentication checks
- **Authentication Flow**: Okta auth state changes

## Usage in Development

### Testing the Feature:
1. **Start the application**
2. **Navigate directly to a protected route** (e.g., `localhost:4200/dashboard/admin/users`)
3. **Verify**: You're redirected to login
4. **Login successfully**
5. **Verify**: You're redirected back to `/dashboard/admin/users` instead of dashboard

### Debugging:
- Check browser's sessionStorage for `'intendedRoute'` key
- Console logs show redirect service activity
- Monitor network tab for navigation events

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users land where they intended to go
2. **Deep Link Support**: Direct links to specific pages work after auth
3. **Page Reload Handling**: Refreshing protected pages works correctly
4. **Bookmark Support**: Bookmarked protected routes work as expected

## Browser Compatibility

- **Session Storage**: Supported in all modern browsers
- **Angular 18**: Compatible with current Angular version
- **TypeScript**: Follows Angular 18 patterns and conventions
