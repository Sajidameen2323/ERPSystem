## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:

2. `supplier-detail.component.html` - Template with comprehensive UI
3. `supplier-detail.component.css` - Custom styling and animations

### Modified Files:
1. `app.routes.ts` - Added supplier detail route
2. `purchase-order-form.component.ts` - Added support for pre-selecting supplier via query params

## Route Configuration
```typescript
{
  path: 'supply-chain/suppliers/:id',
  loadComponent: () => import('./supply-chain/supplier-detail/supplier-detail.component').then(m => m.SupplierDetailComponent),
  canActivate: [inventoryUserGuard]
}
```

## Key Technical Features

### 1. Data Loading Strategy
- **Parallel Loading**: Uses `forkJoin` to load supplier and purchase orders simultaneously

## Usage
1. Navigate to the supplier list page
2. Click the "View Details" (eye icon) button for any supplier
3. Or directly navigate to `/dashboard/supply-chain/suppliers/{supplier-id}`

## Integration Points
- **From Supplier List**: Eye icon links to detail view
