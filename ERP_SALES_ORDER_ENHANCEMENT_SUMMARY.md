# ERP Sales Order Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the SalesOrderService to work like an industry-standard ERP system with the following key improvements:

## 1. Auto-Generated Reference Numbers
- **Format**: `SO-YYYYMM-####` (e.g., SO-202507-0001)
- **Logic**: Sequential numbering per month with 4-digit padding
- **Implementation**: `GenerateReferenceNumberAsync()` method
- **Change**: Removed `ReferenceNumber` field from `SalesOrderCreateDto` since it's now auto-generated

## 2. Stock Management Integration
- **Stock Validation**: Validates stock availability during order creation
- **Stock Reservation**: Reserves stock when order is created (New status)
- **Stock Deduction**: Deducts actual stock when order is shipped
- **Stock Returns**: Returns stock to inventory when order status changes to "Returned"
- **Stock Release**: Releases reserved stock when order is cancelled

## 3. Invoice Creation
- **Auto-Generation**: Invoices are automatically created when order status changes to "Processing"
- **Invoice Numbers**: Format `INV-YYYYMM-####` (e.g., INV-202507-0001)
- **Invoice Items**: Automatically populated from sales order items
- **Default Terms**: 30-day payment terms

## 4. Enhanced Status Management
Status transitions now trigger specific business logic:

### New → Processing
- Validates stock availability
- Creates invoice automatically
- Reserves stock inventory

### Processing → Shipped
- Deducts actual stock from inventory
- Records stock movements with audit trail
- Auto-sets shipped date if not provided

### Any Status → Completed
- Auto-sets delivered date if not provided
- Finalizes the order

### Any Status → Cancelled
- Releases stock reservations
- Maintains audit trail

### Any Status → Returned
- Returns stock back to inventory
- Records return stock movements

## 5. New Models Created

### Invoice Model
```csharp
public class Invoice
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string InvoiceNumber { get; set; }
    public Guid SalesOrderId { get; set; }
    public Guid CustomerId { get; set; }
    public InvoiceStatus Status { get; set; }
    public DateTime InvoiceDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime DueDate { get; set; }
    public decimal SubTotal { get; set; }
    public decimal TaxAmount { get; set; }
    public decimal TotalAmount { get; set; }
    public decimal PaidAmount { get; set; }
    public decimal BalanceAmount { get; set; }
    // ... additional properties
}
```

### Invoice Item Model
```csharp
public class InvoiceItem
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public Guid InvoiceId { get; set; }
    public Guid ProductId { get; set; }
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
    public decimal UnitPrice { get; set; }
    public decimal LineTotal { get; set; }
    // ... additional properties
}
```

## 6. New Services Created
