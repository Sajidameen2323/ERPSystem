## Workflow Integration

### 1. Stock Level Monitoring
```
Product Stock Check → Low Stock Alert → Supplier Selection → PO Creation
```

**Process:**
- System monitors `Product.CurrentStock` vs `Product.MinimumStock`
- Triggers reorder alert when stock falls below minimum
- Suggests preferred suppliers from `ProductSupplier` relationships
- Auto-calculates order quantities based on `MaxStockLevel - CurrentStock`

### 2. Purchase Order Lifecycle
```
Draft → Approved → Ordered → Partial/Fully Received → Closed
```

**Status Flow:**
- **Draft:** Initial creation, editable
- **Approved:** Management approval, locked for editing
- **Ordered:** Sent to supplier, awaiting delivery
- **Received:** Stock received, inventory updated
- **Closed:** Process complete, archived

### 3. Stock Movement Integration
```
PO Received → Stock Movement (IN) → Inventory Update → Cost Tracking
```

**Automated Process:**
- `PurchaseOrderItem.ReceivedQuantity` update triggers:
  - `StockMovement` creation with type `StockIn`
  - `Product.CurrentStock` increment
  - Cost calculation and inventory valuation update

### 4. Supplier Performance Tracking
```
PO Delivery → Lead Time Analysis → Performance Rating → Supplier Ranking
```

**Metrics Tracked:**
- Delivery timeliness vs `ProductSupplier.LeadTimeDays`
- Order accuracy and quality
- Price competitiveness
- Automatic `Supplier.PerformanceRating` updates

## Data Protection & Audit Trail

### Soft Delete Implementation
All business-critical entities protected with `IsDeleted` flag:

- ✅ **Products** - Inventory master data
- ✅ **Suppliers** - Vendor relationships
- ✅ **Purchase Orders** - Financial transactions
- ✅ **Purchase Order Items** - Transaction details
- ✅ **Product Suppliers** - Supplier relationships
- ✅ **Stock Adjustments** - Inventory corrections
- ✅ **Stock Movements** - Complete audit trail

### Audit Features
- **Created/Updated Timestamps** on all entities
- **User Tracking** via Okta integration
- **Immutable History** through soft delete
- **Reference Tracking** for compliance

## Key Business Rules

### Inventory Management
- Stock cannot go negative
- Manual adjustments require approval
- All movements logged with reason codes
- Regular cycle counting integration

### Supply Chain
- Minimum order quantities enforced
- Lead time tracking for planning
- Supplier credit limit monitoring
- Multi-supplier support per product

### Purchase Orders
- Approval workflow based on amount thresholds
- Partial receiving supported
- Cost variance tracking
- Automatic invoice matching preparation

## Integration Points

### 1. Automatic Reordering
```sql
-- Products below minimum stock
SELECT p.SKU, p.CurrentStock, p.MinimumStock, 
       ps.SupplierId, ps.MinimumOrderQuantity
FROM Products p
JOIN ProductSuppliers ps ON p.Id = ps.ProductId
WHERE p.CurrentStock <= p.MinimumStock 
  AND ps.IsPreferredSupplier = 1
  AND p.IsDeleted = 0
```

### 2. Stock Valuation
```sql
-- Current inventory value
SELECT p.SKU, p.CurrentStock, 
       p.CostPrice * p.CurrentStock AS StockValue
FROM Products p
WHERE p.IsDeleted = 0 AND p.CurrentStock > 0
```

### 3. Supplier Performance
```sql
-- Supplier delivery performance
SELECT s.Name, s.PerformanceRating,
       AVG(DATEDIFF(day, po.OrderDate, poi.ReceivedDate)) AS AvgLeadTime
FROM Suppliers s
JOIN PurchaseOrders po ON s.Id = po.SupplierId
JOIN PurchaseOrderItems poi ON po.Id = poi.PurchaseOrderId
WHERE s.IsDeleted = 0 AND po.IsDeleted = 0
GROUP BY s.Id, s.Name, s.PerformanceRating
```

## Future Implementation Roadmap

## Compliance & Standards

- **SOX Compliance:** Complete audit trail maintained
- **GAAP Standards:** Proper inventory valuation methods
- **Data Retention:** 7+ year retention through soft delete
- **User Access Control:** Role-based permissions via Okta
- **Change Tracking:** All modifications logged with user context

## Technical Notes

- All monetary fields use `decimal(18,2)` precision
- DateTime fields stored in UTC for global operations
- Composite indexes on frequently queried relationships
- Soft delete filters applied automatically via EF Core
- Foreign key constraints preserve referential integrity
