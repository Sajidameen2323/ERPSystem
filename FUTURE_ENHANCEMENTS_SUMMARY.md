## Core Feature Enhancements

### 1. Inventory & Supply Chain Overhaul
- **Multi-Location Inventory:** Manage stock across multiple warehouses, stores, and distribution centers with location-aware transfers and stock levels.
- **Supplier-Variant Management:** Track products from different suppliers (e.g., an MSI vs. an ASUS graphics card) as unique variants with distinct costs, stock, and pricing. This enables intelligent, profit-driven stock reservation.
- **Customer Returns Management:** Implement a comprehensive system for handling both full and **partial customer returns**, including quality inspection, restocking, and refund processing.
- **Advanced Procurement:** Automate reordering, track vendor performance, and manage supplier contracts to optimize the supply chain.

### 2. Advanced Product & Manufacturing
- **Rich Product Management:** Define products with custom attributes (size, color), categories, multiple units of measure (UOM), and batch/serial number tracking.
- **Manufacturing Module:** Introduce Bill of Materials (BOM) and Work Order management to support in-house production and assembly.

### 3. Financial & Customer Management
- **Advanced Financials:** Implement sophisticated costing methods (FIFO, LIFO, Weighted Average), budgeting, and forecasting.
- **Enhanced CRM:** Upgrade customer management with interaction history, multiple contacts/addresses, and document management.

### 4. System Architecture & User Experience
- **Reporting & Analytics:** Develop a powerful reporting engine with KPI dashboards and predictive analytics for data-driven decision-making.
- **Modern Architecture:** Evolve towards a microservices architecture for better scalability and maintainability, supported by containerization (Docker/Kubernetes).
- **Enhanced Security:** Implement granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), location-based permissions, and a comprehensive audit trail.
- **Mobile & UX:** Develop mobile applications for warehouse and sales staff and improve the user experience with modern features like customizable dashboards.
